# TeamSCAL
Capstone Project For (Formerly) Team S.C.A.L.

Planz is an event planner that will take out the stress in event planning.  Our web applications includes a chatroom, two polls for location and date/time, as well as a countdown timer to finalize plans.

Planz is built with React.js and Semantic-UI/React in the front end, and express.js and Postgre in the backend.
